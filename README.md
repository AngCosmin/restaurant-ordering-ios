🏆 2nd place

24 hours hackathon where we created an iOS application for restaurants where users can scan a QR code placed on the table and the restaurant menu will show and you can buy items and the people at the bar receive your command on a dashboard (website). After they bring you the products you can pay and even split bill with other people at the same table.

Technologies used: `Swift` `Flask` `MySQL` `Cocoapods` `VueJS` `NodeJS`
